# Detecting Frauds In Digital Payments Using Machine Learning Models
Overview
Thisprojectaims tofindanoptimal algorithm
 by evaluating both supervised and
 unsupervisedmachinelearningalgorithms.
 Objectives-Conducting an evaluation of the existing
 literature related to detecting frauds in
 digitalpayments.-Pre-process datausing suitable sampling
 techniques, feature engineering and
 justifyingthechoiceofthetechniques.-Implementingsupervisedandunsupervised
 learning algorithms and validating the
 modelsthroughtrainingandtesting.-Evaluating theperformanceof themodels
 usingthepre-definedmetrics.-Documenting the testing and evaluation
 results and their applicability to the
