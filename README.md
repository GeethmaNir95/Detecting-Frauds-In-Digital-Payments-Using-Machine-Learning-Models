## Detecting Frauds In Digital Payments Using Machine Learning Models
## Overview<br>
 This project aims to find an optimal algorithm by evaluating both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
## Objectives<br>
 -Conducting an evaluation of the existing literature related to detecting frauds in digitalpayments.<br> -Pre-process data using suitable sampling techniques, feature engineering and  justifying the choice of the techniques.<br>
 -Implementing supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and validating the models through training and testing.<br>
 -Evaluating the performance of the models using the pre-defined metrics.<br>
 -Documenting the testing and evaluation results and their applicability to the scientifi crepository of knowledge.
